# Projects-Showcase
A showcase for all previous projects I worked on

Those are old projects from 2013-2014. The code is mine, the design, however, belongs to the designers I worked with.

## License:  
Even though the code is old and not up to my current standards, I permit users to use portions of my code in their projects. However, please give credit when it's due.  
**Please do NOT copy the design and rip it off for your own projects, as it is NOT mine and only the designers have the rights to it.**

## Disclaimer:  
I am not affiliated with any political party or any firm that is displayed in my work. Those were jobs I was hired for by my company and had no affiliation with the clients themselves.
